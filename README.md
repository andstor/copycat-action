> GitHub Action for copying files to other repositories.

This is a [GitHub action](https://developer.github.com/actions/) to copy files from your repository to another external repository. It is also possible to copy files from/to repository Wikis.

This action runs in a Docker container and therefore only supports Linux.

## Usage

The following example [workflow step](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) will copy all files from the repository running the action, to a folder named `backup` in the destination repo `copycat-action`. If the files already exist at the destination repo, they will be overwritten.

```yml
- name: Copy
  uses: andstor/copycat-action@v3
  with:
    personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
    src_path: /.
    dst_path: /backup/
    dst_owner: andstor
    dst_repo_name: copycat-action
```

## Options ⚙️

The following input variable options can/must be configured:

|Input variable|Necessity|Description|Default|
|--------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
|`src_path`|Required|The source path to the file(s) or folder(s) to copy from. For example `/.` or `path/to/home.md`.||
|`dst_path`|Optional|The destination path to copy the file(s) or folder(s) to. For example `/wiki/` or `path/to/index.md`. |`src_path`|
|`dst_owner`|Required|The name of the owner of the repository to push to. For example `andstor`.||
|`dst_repo_name`|Required|The name of the repository to push to. For example `copycat-action`.||
|`src_branch`|Optional|The name of the branch in source repository to clone from.|`master`|
|`dst_branch`|Optional|The name of the branch in the destination repository to push to. If the branch doesn't exists, the branch will be created based on the default branch.|`master`|
|`clean`|Optional|Set to `true` if the `dst_path` should be emptied before copying.|`false`|
|`file_filter`|Optional|A simple [pattern](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html#Shell-Pattern-Matching) for filtering files to be copied. Acts on file basename. For example `*.sh`.||
|`filter`|Optional|A glob pattern for filtering files to be copied. Acts on file paths. For example `**/!(*.*)`.||
|`exclude`|Optional|A glob pattern for excluding paths. For example `*/tests/*`.||
|`src_wiki`|Optional|Set to `true` if the source repository you want to copy from is the GitHub Wiki.| `false`|
|`dst_wiki`|Optional|Set to `true` if the destination repository you want to copy from is the GitHub Wiki.|`false`|
|`commit_message`|Optional|A custom git commit message.||
|`username`|Optional|The GitHub username to associate commits made by this GitHub action.|[`GITHUB_ACTOR`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables)|
|`email`|Optional|The email used for associating commits made by this GitHub action.|[`GITHUB_ACTOR`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables) `@users.noreply.github.com`|

## Secrets

* `personal_token`: (required) GitHub Private Access Token used for the clone/push operations. To create it follow the [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

## Filtering
Copycat provides several ways of filtering which files you want to copy.  
All three types of filtering can be applied simultaneously.

### Input variables
#### `file_filter`
The `file_filter`input variable allows you to filter file basenames. Hence, you can for example only copy all text files by setting `file_filter`to `*.txt`. The variable only accepts simple [patterns](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html#Shell-Pattern-Matching).

#### `filter`
The `filter` input variable provides extensive globbing support. It also supports extended globbing and globstar. The globbing applies to file paths. So, to for example match all files that doesn't have a file extention, the pattern could look like `**/!(*.*)`.

#### `exclude`
The `exclude` input variable can be used to exclude certain paths. It will apply to the file paths. One are for example able to exclude certain deirectory names. Setting `exclude` to `*/tests/*` results in only copying files that don't lie inside a folder named `tests` (both directly and indirectly). Here, a file with for example the path `foo/tests/bar/baz.txt` would not be copied over.

## Examples

### Copy wiki files to external repo

This workflow configuration will copy all files from the repository's wiki to a folder named `wiki` in the destination repo `andstor.github.io`.

This can for example be used to merge several wikies of an organisation, and display them on a custom GitHub Pages site. The Jekyll theme [Paper](https://github.com/andstor/jekyll-theme-paper) has support for this.

```yml
name: Copy
on: gollum
jobs:
  copy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Copycat
      uses: andstor/copycat-action@v3
      with:
        personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        src_path: /.
        dst_path: /wiki/
        dst_owner: andstor
        dst_repo_name: andstor.github.io
        dst_branch: master
        src_branch: master
        src_wiki: true
        dst_wiki: false
        username: nutsbot
        email: andr3.storhaug+bot@gmail.com
```


## Troubleshooting

### Cloning Failed
Error:
```
warning: Could not find remote branch <...> to clone.
fatal: Remote branch <...> not found in upstream origin
Cloning '<...>' failed
```
By default, `copycat-action` creates a destination branch if it doesn't exist. See more discussion [here](https://github.com/andstor/copycat-action/issues/25).
If your cloning fails, it is likely due to a typo when you provided the `src_branch` and/or `dst_branch` args to `copycat-action`.

If you don't explicitly provide the `src_branch` and/or `dst_branch` args to `copycat-action`, your default branch names should both be "master". Otherwise you'll get an error very similar to above.

Reference:
```yaml
src_branch:
description: 'The branch name of the source repository'
required: false
default: 'master'

dst_branch:
description: 'The branch name of the destination repository'
required: false
default: 'master'
```

A while back, GitHub started naming the master branch "main" by default. Since `copycat-action` looks for a "master" branch by default, you have to explicity provide branch names if you are using Github's new naming convention "main" for your default branch. Obviously if you are already using custom branch names, you have to explicity specify them.

We are keeping the default for both args as "master" since it is compliant with the *majority* of repos out there.

I might make a PR to add this to the readme, since it's very easy to look over.
